# Training Monotony and Strain: What the Science Says and How Coaches Can Use It

You finish a busy month.

The weekly volume looked reasonable.\
ACWR was under control.\
But some players still look flat:

- They complain about doing “the same session every day”
- Minor soft-tissue issues and colds start to appear
- Motivation in training drops, even though total load has not increased much

If you only look at **how much** load you give players, you might miss **how that load is distributed** across the week.

That is where **training monotony** and **training strain** come in.

These ideas come from classic work by Carl Foster and colleagues, who showed that periods with **higher training monotony and strain were associated with more banal illnesses and overtraining symptoms** in experienced athletes. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0} More recently, researchers have described how monotony and strain fluctuate across football seasons and how extreme values may relate to performance changes or non-contact injury risk, although the evidence is not yet consistent. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

In this article, you will learn:

- What **training monotony** and **training strain** actually are
- What the **science really says** about their relationship with health and performance
- How to calculate them using **session-RPE**
- How to use them **practically and safely** in football, especially in small and medium clubs

## What Are Training Monotony and Training Strain?

### Training Monotony: How “Samey” Your Week Is

In simple terms, **training monotony** describes **how much your daily loads vary inside a week**.

- If every day has a similar load → **high monotony**
- If you alternate clearly hard, medium, and light days → **lower monotony**

Foster originally defined training monotony (using internal load) as: :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

> **Training Monotony = Mean Daily Load (over 7 days) ÷ Standard Deviation (SD) of Daily Load**

If day-to-day variation is small (SD is small), the ratio becomes **high** – meaning the week is quite repetitive.

### Training Strain: How Big and How Monotonous

**Training strain** combines:

- **How big** the weekly load is
- **How monotonous** that load is

Foster defined training strain as: :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

> **Training Strain = Weekly Load × Training Monotony**

So, a week can have:

- Big weekly load + **low** monotony → moderate strain
- Big weekly load + **high** monotony → **very high strain**
- Low weekly load + high monotony → still relevant (maybe boring and under-stimulating)

In most applied settings today, **weekly load** is calculated from **session-RPE** or heart-rate-based training impulse (TRIMP).

At Fractall, we use **internal load from session-RPE** (RPE × minutes) as the base, which is realistic for small and medium clubs without GPS.

**Coach Takeaway:**\
Monotony = *how repetitive the week is*.\
Strain = *how big the week is* × *how repetitive it is*.

## Why Monotony and Strain Matter in Football

Foster’s original work in endurance athletes showed that **spikes in training load, monotony and strain coincided with more banal illnesses**, and that thresholds could be computed that best explained these episodes. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5} Later guidance on overtraining and overreaching also highlights **high monotony and high strain as recognised risk markers** when combined with intensive training. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}

In football:

- Training and competition calendars can be congested
- Match minutes vary between players from week to week
- Tactical roles (e.g., fullback vs. central defender) affect load
- Travel, school/work, and life stress add extra strain

Observational studies in professional and youth football show that **weekly training load, monotony and strain vary across pre-season and in-season**, and that **periods with unusually high monotony or strain may align with higher non-contact injury incidence or changes in fitness markers**, although results differ between squads and methods. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}

Systematic reviews in soccer report that **ACWR and monotony are useful to describe how load changes over the season**, but **evidence linking them strongly and consistently to injury risk is limited**, especially in youth. They recommend using these metrics to understand patterns rather than as stand-alone injury predictors. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}

Broader consensus statements from the IOC on training load and health reinforce the overall picture: **poor load management, rapid changes in load, and congested competition** are important risk factors for injury, illness, and overtraining, and monitoring both load and athlete well-being is recommended. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}

**Coach Takeaway:**\
Monotony and strain help you see when you are delivering **too much of the same thing**, especially in big weeks or congested periods – a situation that the broader sports-science literature associates with higher risk of fatigue, illness, and maladaptation.

## How to Calculate Monotony and Strain with Session-RPE

We will use **internal training load from session-RPE**, a method that has been widely validated and used in football and other team sports.

If you need a refresher on session-RPE and basic training load, start here:\
👉 [**RPE Basics for Coaches: How to Use Session-RPE to Monitor Training Load**](/blog/rpe-basics-session-rpe-training-load)

You can then layer ACWR on top:\
👉 [**ACWR in Football: How to Use It Safely and Effectively (Coach’s Guide)**](/blog/acwr-explained-football-coach-guide)

### Step 1 – Compute Daily Load

For each session:

> **Session Load = RPE × Duration (minutes)**

If there are multiple sessions in a day (e.g., gym + field), sum them to get **Daily Load**.

### Step 2 – Compute Weekly Load (7 Days)

For a 7-day window (e.g., Monday–Sunday):

> **Weekly Load = Sum of the 7 Daily Loads**

This is the same weekly load you would use for ACWR.

### Step 3 – Compute Weekly Monotony

For the same 7-day window:

1. Calculate the **mean** of the 7 daily loads.
1. Calculate the **standard deviation (SD)** of those 7 daily loads.
1. Apply the Foster formula:

> **Training Monotony = Mean Daily Load ÷ SD of Daily Load** :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}

If the SD is small (days all look similar), monotony becomes **high**.

### Step 4 – Compute Weekly Strain

Finally:

> **Training Strain = Weekly Load × Training Monotony** :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}

Higher weekly load and higher monotony → higher strain.

### Example: Same Weekly Load, Different Monotony and Strain

#### Week A – “Flat” Week (High Monotony)

{% table %}
- Day
- Load (AU)
---
- Mon
- 400
---
- Tue
- 420
---
- Wed
- 410
---
- Thu
- 430
---
- Fri
- 400
---
- Sat
- 0
---
- Sun
- 700 (match)
{% /table %}

- Weekly Load = 2,760 AU
- Mean Daily Load ≈ 394 AU
- SD of Daily Load is **small** (days are similar)

Result: **High monotony**, and therefore **high strain**.

#### Week B – “Wave” Week (Lower Monotony, Same Total Load)

{% table %}
- Day
- Load (AU)
---
- Mon
- 150
---
- Tue
- 600
---
- Wed
- 200
---
- Thu
- 650
---
- Fri
- 100
---
- Sat
- 0
---
- Sun
- 1,060 (match)
{% /table %}

- Weekly Load still ≈ 2,760 AU
- Mean Daily Load ≈ 394 AU
- SD is **larger** (clear light and hard days)

Result: **Lower monotony** and **lower strain**, even though the weekly total is identical.

**Coach Takeaway:**\
Two weeks with the same total volume can be **very different** from the body’s perspective depending on **how you distribute the load across days**.

## What the Science Says: Benefits and Limitations

### Where Monotony and Strain Are Helpful

- Foster’s work showed that **higher training load, monotony and strain were associated with increases in banal illnesses and overreaching symptoms**, suggesting these indicators are useful for identifying problematic periods. :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}
- Practical guides and reviews on overtraining include **training monotony and strain** among the factors practitioners should watch when evaluating risk, along with rapid load increases, competition frequency, and lifestyle stress. :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}
- In football, studies have described how monotony and strain vary across pre-season and in-season, and how patterns of high monotony and strain interact with changes in aerobic fitness and strength. :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}
- Some work in professional football has reported associations between **higher workload monotony/strain and non-contact injury incidence**, reinforcing the idea that big, monotonous weeks may be riskier, especially for certain players.

### Where We Need Caution

- Systematic reviews focusing on soccer indicate that **only a few studies show clear associations between higher monotony and injury risk**, and that these relationships are often small and context-dependent. :contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}
- Methodological papers have pointed out that average weekly metrics like monotony can sometimes **hide individual differences or day-to-day context**, and that they should be interpreted with care. :contentReference[oaicite:18]{index=18}
- IOC consensus statements emphasise that **load management is important**, but also stress the role of **sleep, stress, travel, previous injury and psychological load** in injury and illness, not just training load metrics. :contentReference[oaicite:19]{index=19}

In other words, monotony and strain are **useful indicators**, but they are **not injury prediction tools**.

**Coach Takeaway:**\
Use monotony and strain to **understand patterns and highlight weeks that deserve extra attention**, not to make automatic “play/don’t play” decisions.

## Common Mistakes When Coaches Use Monotony and Strain

### Mistake 1 – Treating Monotony as Always Bad

**The mistake:**\
Thinking “high monotony is always bad, low monotony is always good”.

**Reality:**

- Some microcycles (e.g., short congested weeks) will **naturally** be more monotonous.
- A short block of slightly higher monotony may be acceptable if load is moderate and wellness is good.
- The bigger concern is **sustained high monotony combined with high weekly load and poor wellness**.

**Coach Takeaway:**\
Look for **patterns over several weeks**, not single “bad” weeks.

---

### Mistake 2 – Looking Only at Ratios, Not at Weekly Load

**The mistake:**\
Focusing only on monotony or strain without understanding the absolute weekly load.

**Fix:**

Always interpret:

- **Weekly Load** (how big is the week?)
- **Monotony** (how repetitive?)
- **Strain** (big × repetitive?)
- **ACWR** (how does this week compare with the last 3 weeks?)
- **Wellness and pain**

For ACWR context, see:\
👉 [**ACWR in Football: How to Use It Safely and Effectively (Coach’s Guide)**](/blog/acwr-explained-football-coach-guide)

**Coach Takeaway:**\
Ratios are only meaningful when you know what **load** produced them.

---

### Mistake 3 – Ignoring Wellness, Pain and Psychological Load

**The mistake:**\
Using monotony and strain alone, without checking **sleep, soreness, mood, stress, or pain**.

**Fix:**

- Monitor **wellness** (sleep, fatigue, soreness, stress, mood).
- Track **pain locations and trends**.
- Combine these with load metrics: if monotony and strain rise **and** wellness drops, the risk picture is clearer.

For more on this side:

- 👉 [**Wellness Monitoring 101: Sleep, Fatigue, Soreness, Stress, and Mood Explained**](/blog/wellness-monitoring-team-sports)
- 👉 [**Early Warning Signs of Overload and Injury Risk in Team Sports**](/blog/early-warning-signs-injury-risk)

**Coach Takeaway:**\
Load metrics say **what you did to players**. Wellness and pain say **how they are coping**.

---

### Mistake 4 – Over-Engineering the System for a Small Staff

**The mistake:**\
Trying to build a research-grade monitoring system with limited time and people, then abandoning it.

**Fix:**

- Start simple: weekly **load, monotony, strain, ACWR**, plus wellness.
- Automate calculations where possible (e.g., with platforms like Fractall).
- Put most of your energy into **interpreting the data and adjusting the plan**, not into Excel formulas.

**Coach Takeaway:**\
A **simple, consistent** system used all season is better than a complex system you drop after a month.

## How Coaches Can Use Monotony and Strain in Practice

### 1. Check the “Shape” of the Week, Not Only the Volume

When you review a week, ask:

- Is there a clear **high-load day** (e.g., MD-3), one or two **moderate days**, and a **light MD-1**?
- Or did we accidentally create three or four **similar medium days**?

Use:

- **Weekly Load** to check the overall size
- **Monotony** to see how varied the days were
- **Strain** to see whether a big week was also very monotonous

### 2. Flag High-Strain Weeks in Congested Periods

In periods with:

- Two or three matches per week
- Tournaments and cup runs
- End-of-season schedule congestion

High strain can highlight players who:

- Played many minutes
- Had little day-to-day variation
- Are more exposed to illness, fatigue, or non-contact injury

What you can do:

- Slightly reduce volume or intensity for selected sessions
- Use more targeted **recovery strategies**
- Rotate intelligently when possible
- Monitor **wellness and pain** more closely

### 3. Use Monotony to Improve Weekly Design

If you see **chronically high monotony**:

- Check whether your “high” and “low” days are truly different in load.
- Ensure MD-3 is clearly higher than MD-1 in internal load.
- Consider how **gym sessions, conditioning blocks, and extras** contribute to daily totals.

The goal is not random variation, but **purposeful variation**: days that are clearly for **stimulus**, days for **consolidation**, and days for **recovery and freshness**.

### 4. Combine Monotony/Strain with ACWR

- **ACWR** (e.g., 7-day acute / 21-day chronic) tells you **how big this week is compared with recent weeks**.
- **Monotony and strain** tell you **how this week is structured internally**.

For example:

- High ACWR + high monotony + high strain + poor wellness = **strong signal** to adjust.
- Moderate ACWR + moderate monotony + good wellness = usually acceptable.

**Coach Takeaway:**\
Think of ACWR as **“size vs recent history”** and monotony/strain as **“shape of the week”**. Together, they give a richer picture.

## How High Is “High”? Practical Ranges and Thresholds

Applied literature and workload monitoring guides often suggest that:

- Weekly **training monotony values above \~2.0** (when combined with high training load) may be associated with a higher likelihood of maladaptive responses such as illness, overreaching, or under-recovery in adult athletes. :contentReference[oaicite:20]{index=20}

However:

- These thresholds were developed mainly in **endurance and individual sports**, not specifically football.
- Systematic reviews in soccer stress that we should **not treat these values as universal cut-offs**, but rather as **practical warning levels** to prompt closer review. :contentReference[oaicite:21]{index=21}

**Coach Takeaway:**\
Treat values like monotony ≳2.0 as **“check this week more carefully”**, not as an automatic “danger zone”.

## FAQs: Training Monotony and Strain

### 1. What is a “high” training monotony value?

There is no universal cut-off, but based on Foster’s work and applied guidelines, **monotony values above \~2.0 (arbitrary units)** in adult athletes, especially when combined with high training load, are often treated as a **practical warning level** for increased risk of maladaptive responses. :contentReference[oaicite:22]{index=22}

Interpret this together with:

- Weekly load
- Player history
- Wellness and pain
- Match schedule

---

### 2. Can low monotony be a problem?

Yes, if:

- The week is **chaotic**, with extreme highs and lows that athletes are not prepared for
- High-intensity sessions are clustered without adequate recovery

The goal is not “as low as possible”, but **purposeful variation**:

- Hard days clearly hard
- Easy days clearly easy
- Logical sequencing across the week

---

### 3. Should youth teams use monotony and strain?

Youth teams **can** use these metrics, but with care:

- Focus on avoiding **extreme patterns** and obvious problematic weeks
- Combine them with an understanding of **growth, maturation, school stress, and other sports**
- Use them for **education and planning**, not for strict thresholds or punitive decisions

For many academies, simply tracking **weekly load**, **ACWR** and **obvious spikes** gives most of the benefit, with monotony/strain as an extra layer.

---

### 4. Do I need GPS to use monotony and strain?

No. Training monotony and strain work very well with **internal load from session-RPE**, as originally described by Foster and widely used in practice. :contentReference[oaicite:23]{index=23}

If you have GPS, you can also compute **external-load monotony/strain** (distance, high-speed running, etc.), but that is optional.

---

## Summary: Coach-Friendly Recap

- **Training monotony** measures how **repetitive** your daily loads are over a week.
- **Training strain** combines **weekly load** with **monotony** to reflect **how big and how monotonous** a week is.
- Classic and consensus work links **high monotony and strain**, especially with high load, to increased risk of **illness, overreaching and under-recovery**, and modern football studies describe how these metrics fluctuate across the season and may relate to performance and injury patterns. :contentReference[oaicite:24]{index=24}
- However, monotony and strain are **not stand-alone injury prediction tools**; they are **contextual indicators** to support better decisions.
- For small and medium clubs, calculating them from **session-RPE** fits naturally with **ACWR** and **wellness monitoring**.
- Platforms like **Fractall** automate these calculations and combine them with wellness and pain data, helping you make **quicker, more informed decisions** without being buried in spreadsheets.

**Coach Takeaway:**\
You do not need a PhD or a GPS system to benefit from training monotony and strain. With simple RPE-based load data and a consistent routine, you can spot weeks that are **too big and too similar**, adjust before problems appear, and support players with **smarter, more varied microcycles**.
