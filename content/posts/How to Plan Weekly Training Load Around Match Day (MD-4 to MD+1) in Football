# How to Plan Weekly Training Load Around Match Day (MD-4 to MD+1)

You know the feeling.

One week, your team looks fresh and aggressive on match day.  
The next week, with almost the same number of sessions, players look heavy:

- Sprints are slower  
- Decision-making is late  
- Soft-tissue “tightness” and fatigue complaints increase  

The problem usually isn’t **how many** sessions you did.  
It’s **how the load was distributed** from **MD-4 to MD+1**.

Research in professional football shows that:

- Training load is typically **highest earlier in the week (MD-4 / MD-3)**  
- Then it **tapers down** as match day approaches (MD-2 / MD-1) :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  
- Match day itself provides a **unique, highest stimulus** in both volume and intensity :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  

In this guide, we will turn that evidence into a **simple, RPE-based weekly plan** that small and medium clubs can actually use.

## Understanding the MD- System and the Weekly Microcycle

### What MD-4, MD-3, MD-2, MD-1 and MD+1 Mean

In most football research and high-performance environments, days are labelled relative to the main match:

- **MD** = Match Day  
- **MD-1** = 1 day before the match  
- **MD-2** = 2 days before the match  
- **MD-3 / MD-4** = 3 or 4 days before the match  
- **MD+1** = 1 day after the match  

Studies in professional leagues consistently use this structure to describe and compare training and match loads over a typical week. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

This “microcycle” is the basic unit of weekly planning in football.

### Why the Microcycle Structure Matters

Full-season studies show that:

- **External load (total distance, high-speed running, etc.) generally declines from MD-4 toward MD-1** as coaches taper into the game :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
- The exact **shape of this taper** and how it changes in weeks with 1, 2, or 3 games can affect both **performance and recovery** :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  

Consensus statements from the IOC emphasise that **rapid load changes** and **poor load distribution** across the week are key risk factors for injury and illness, and recommend structured load management over micro- and mesocycle levels. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}  

**Coach Takeaway:**  
The microcycle is not just a schedule; it is your main tool to **balance performance, recovery, and injury risk**. The MD- labels help you anchor training content and intensity around the match.

## Core Principles for Weekly Training Load Around Match Day

Before we draw any tables, three evidence-informed principles should guide how you structure MD-4 to MD+1.

### Principle 1 – Match Day Is a Unique Stimulus

GPS-based studies show that match day has:

- The **highest total distance and high-speed running**  
- The most intense **worst-case scenarios** (short periods with very high intensity) :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}  

Training should prepare players for this, not regularly exceed it.

### Principle 2 – Load High Earlier, Taper Toward MD

Work in professional teams shows that structured microcycles typically: :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}  

- Use **MD-3 and MD-4** as the main **loading days** (higher volume and/or intensity)  
- Use **MD-2** as a **moderate** day  
- Use **MD-1** as a **short, low-load, sharpness-focused** day  

### Principle 3 – Respect Post-Match Recovery, Especially for Youth

Recent research in elite youth players shows that:

- **Performance and recovery markers can still be impaired 48 h after a match**  
- A **high-volume, high-intensity session 48 h post-match** can negatively affect recovery compared with a moderate session :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}  

This highlights the need to treat **MD+1 and MD+2** carefully, especially with younger squads.

**Coach Takeaway:**  
For a one-match week, aim for:  
**MD+1** = recovery and compensation  
**MD-4 / MD-3** = main load  
**MD-2** = moderate, with tactical focus  
**MD-1** = short, light, sharp

---

## Using Internal Load (Session-RPE) to Drive the Plan

You do not need GPS to build a smart weekly structure.

We will use **internal training load** from **session-RPE**, which is:

> **Session Load = RPE × Duration (minutes)**

This is the same basis used in our other articles:

- 👉 **[RPE Basics for Coaches: How to Use Session-RPE to Monitor Training Load](/blog/rpe-basics-session-rpe-training-load)**  
- 👉 **[ACWR in Football: How to Use It Safely and Effectively (Coach’s Guide)](/blog/acwr-explained-football-coach-guide)**  
- 👉 **[Training Monotony and Strain in Football: What the Science Says and How Coaches Can Use It](/blog/training-monotony-strain-football-load-monitoring)**  

Using RPE × minutes, you can:

- Estimate **daily and weekly load** for each player  
- Track how **MD-4 to MD+1** change across the season  
- Monitor **ACWR, monotony and strain** without expensive tracking systems

**Coach Takeaway:**  
Internal load (RPE × duration) is enough to build a **research-aligned weekly structure**, even in clubs without GPS.

---

## A Practical One-Match Week Template (MD-4 to MD+1)

Below is a simple, evidence-informed template for a **7-day microcycle** with **one match** and **four main football sessions**.

We will think in **relative internal load** (approximate % of match load for a typical starter) and **session goals**.

### Proposed Weekly Structure (Starters)

| Day   | Label | Typical Focus                            | Approx. Load vs Match* | Example RPE × Duration |
|-------|-------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| MD+1  | +1    | Recovery + compensation (non-starters)   | Starters: very low (~20–30%); Non-starters: moderate (~60–80%) | Starters: RPE 2–3 × 20–30'; Non-starters: RPE 5–6 × 40–60' |
| MD-4  | -4    | Main high-intensity football day         | ~60–80% of match      | RPE 6–8 × 60–75'       |
| MD-3  | -3    | High volume / extensive day              | ~70–90% of match      | RPE 6–7 × 70–80'       |
| MD-2  | -2    | Moderate load, tactical + units          | ~40–60% of match      | RPE 5–6 × 50–65'       |
| MD-1  | -1    | Short, low-load, speed & set-pieces      | ~20–30% of match      | RPE 3–4 × 30–45'       |
| MD    | 0     | Match (reference)                        | 100%                   | RPE 7–9 × 90–100'      |

\*These percentages are **illustrative internal-load targets**, inspired by data from professional microcycle studies that describe higher training loads earlier in the week and a taper toward MD-1. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}  

### MD+1 – Recovery and Compensation

**Starters**

- Short, very low-load session or off-feet recovery  
- Light mobility, low-intensity aerobic exercise, basic technical work  
- Wellness screening and pain check

**Non-starters / low-minute players**

- Higher-load “compensation” session to bring weekly load closer to starters  
- Small-sided games and conditioning blocks (RPE 5–6)  
- Avoid extremely high intensity; remember recovery science still applies

Recent work in youth players suggests that **heavy training 48 h after a match can impair recovery**, so you should be especially conservative if your MD+1 is effectively 24–48 h post-match. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}  

**Coach Takeaway:**  
MD+1 is not “just another training”. It should **start the next week’s plan** with recovery and targeted compensation, not with a hidden second match.

---

### MD-4 – Main High-Intensity Football Day

- Often the **highest-intensity day** (especially in RPE and high-speed running) in structured professional microcycles :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}  
- Use smaller spaces and more aggressive work:rest ratios to stress **acceleration, deceleration, duels, and pressing**  
- Can include strength/power work (gym) away from the pitch

Content ideas:

- Positional games and SSGs with clear tactical objectives  
- High-intensity pressing and transition drills  
- Short, intense blocks (e.g., 4–6 × 4') with high emphasis on effort

**Coach Takeaway:**  
MD-4 is your **main stimulus** day. Aim for a solid internal load, but still within **~60–80% of match** for starters.

---

### MD-3 – High Volume / Extensive Day

- Often one of the **highest volume days** in distance terms (bigger spaces, more running) :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}  
- Slightly less intense than MD-4, but longer work periods and larger areas  
- Good day for **game model work in larger spaces**, unit interactions, and extensive conditioning

Content ideas:

- 8v8, 10v10 or 11v11 on larger areas with tactical focus  
- Attacking and defensive organisation in realistic game scenarios  
- Running-based drills (e.g., position-specific patterns) with the ball

**Coach Takeaway:**  
MD-3 often “looks easy” because it’s more tactical, but total load can be high. Use RPE × minutes to ensure it does not accidentally **rival match day**.

---

### MD-2 – Moderate, Tactical, and Units

- Volume and intensity should **start clearly tapering** :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}  
- Focus on **game plan, units, and set-pieces**, with controlled intensity  
- Key day for **clarity**, not exhaustion

Content ideas:

- Unit-based work (defensive line, midfield, forwards)  
- Specific patterns against expected opponent behaviours  
- Short tactical games (e.g., 7v7 + neutral) with constraints, but controlled RPE

**Coach Takeaway:**  
If players finish MD-2 “dead”, you probably overloaded the last 48 hours before the match. Aim for **moderate internal load**, not a second main session.

---

### MD-1 – Short, Light, and Sharp

- Should be **clearly the lowest training load day** before the match in structured microcycles :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}  
- Focus on **speed, sharpness, confidence, and set-pieces**  
- Short session length, low volume, moderate intensity in short bursts

Content ideas:

- Speed / neuromuscular activation (short sprints with full recovery)  
- Simple rondos and position-specific technical work  
- Set-pieces: offensive and defensive routines, restarts

**Coach Takeaway:**  
MD-1 is about **fine-tuning and confidence**, not fitness. Players should leave the pitch feeling **fast and fresh**, not tired.

---

## Adapting the Plan for Different Players and Contexts

### Starters vs Non-Starters

Studies consistently show that **starters and non-starters accumulate different weekly loads**, which is a risk for under- or over-loading certain groups. :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}  

Practical adjustments:

- **Starters:** Follow the main template, but consider slightly reducing MD-4 or MD-3 load for players coming back from injury or with high ACWR.  
- **Non-starters / Low-minute players:**  
  - Higher compensation on MD+1  
  - Maintain slightly **higher weekly training/match ratios** across MD-4 to MD-2 to keep them ready.


### Congested Weeks (2–3 Matches)

With multiple matches, the available MD- slots shrink.

Research shows:

- Microcycle length (5, 6, 7 days) affects how much load you can realistically fit between games :contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}  
- Trying to “fit a normal week” into a short microcycle usually leads to excessive cumulative load

Practical adjustments:

- Prioritise **recovery, tactical clarity, and short, sharp sessions**  
- Accept that **fitness gains** come from the match load itself and previous weeks  
- Use **very small load top-ups** for non-starters, not full “extra matches” in training

**Coach Takeaway:**  
Your weekly template must be **flexible**, especially in youth and congested periods. The principles stay; the volume and intensity adjust.

---

## Integrating ACWR, Monotony, and Wellness into Weekly Planning

Designing MD-4 to MD+1 is only one part of the picture.

To make the plan **robust over weeks and months**, combine it with:

- **ACWR** – to check how this week compares with the last 3 weeks  
  👉 **[ACWR in Football: How to Use It Safely and Effectively](/blog/acwr-explained-football-coach-guide)**  
- **Training monotony and strain** – to spot weeks that are big and very repetitive  
  👉 **[Training Monotony and Strain in Football](/blog/training-monotony-strain-football-load-monitoring)**  
- **Wellness & pain data** – to see how players are coping  
  👉 **[Wellness Monitoring 101](/blog/wellness-monitoring-team-sports)**  
  👉 **[Early Warning Signs of Overload and Injury Risk](/blog/early-warning-signs-injury-risk)**  

IOC consensus statements make it clear: **load, wellness, psychological stress, and history** all interact in determining injury and illness risk. :contentReference[oaicite:18]{index=18}  

**Coach Takeaway:**  
The weekly structure is your **starting blueprint**; monitoring tells you whether you need to **adjust the plan** up or down for specific players.

## FAQs: Weekly Training Load Around Match Day

### 1. How hard should MD-4 and MD-3 be compared with the match?

Studies that express training load as a percentage of match load usually show that:

- The **harder training days** (often MD-4 or MD-3) may reach **60–90% of match external load** for some metrics, depending on the club and context. :contentReference[oaicite:19]{index=19}  

Practically, for internal load (RPE × minutes):

- Aim for **high, but not match-equivalent** load on MD-3/MD-4 for starters  
- Allow non-starters to accumulate **slightly higher relative training/match ratios** to stay prepared

---

### 2. How low should MD-1 be?

In structured microcycles:

- MD-1 is consistently the **lowest-load training day** in both external and internal load when compared with MD-4, MD-3, and MD-2. :contentReference[oaicite:20]{index=20}  

Practically:

- Think **short, light, sharp**: ~20–30% of match internal load, focused on **speed and set-pieces**.

---

### 3. Should youth teams use the same MD-4 to MD+1 structure?

The basic logic still applies, but with adjustments:

- Youth squads often need **more conservative volumes** and **more recovery focus**  
- Recent youth data shows that heavy training 48 h post-match can impair recovery; avoid overloading MD+2 in tightly packed schedules :contentReference[oaicite:21]{index=21}  

Use the same structure but:

- Lower the overall weekly load  
- Be very responsive to wellness data and growth-related issues

---

### 4. What about weeks with two or three matches?

In congested weeks:

- The **matches themselves provide the main training stimulus**  
- There is less space for classic MD-4 / MD-3 heavy days  

Research on 1-, 2-, and 3-game weeks shows that load naturally compresses as more games are added, and trying to keep “normal” training loads between games can create excessive cumulative load. :contentReference[oaicite:22]{index=22}  

Practically:

- Focus on **recovery, tactical clarity, and short, sharp sessions**  
- Accept a reduced total training load and use **very targeted top-ups** for non-starters  

---

## Summary: Coach-Friendly Recap

- Planning weekly training load around MD-4 to MD+1 is about **shape**, not just volume.  
- Evidence from professional football shows that **MD-4 and MD-3** are usually the **heavier training days**, with a clear taper toward **MD-1**, and match day remains the most intense stimulus. :contentReference[oaicite:23]{index=23}  
- Using **internal load (RPE × duration)**, you can build a robust microcycle in any club:  
  - **MD+1**: recovery + compensation  
  - **MD-4 / MD-3**: main load days  
  - **MD-2**: moderate tactical session  
  - **MD-1**: short, light, sharp  
- Combine this weekly structure with **ACWR, training monotony/strain, and wellness data** to manage risk and support performance. :contentReference[oaicite:24]{index=24}  
- Tools like **Fractall** automate the calculations and visualisation, so coaches can spend less time on spreadsheets and more time coaching.

**Coach Takeaway:**  
You do not need a huge staff or complex technology to plan a smart MD-4 to MD+1 microcycle. With **session-RPE, simple guidelines, and consistent monitoring**, you can design weeks that make your players **ready for the match**, not exhausted by it.
