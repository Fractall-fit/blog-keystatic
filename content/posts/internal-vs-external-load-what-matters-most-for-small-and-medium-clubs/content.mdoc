# Internal vs External Load: What Matters Most for Small and Medium Clubs?

If you’re a coach in a small or medium club, you’ve probably asked yourself:

- *“Do I really need GPS to monitor training load?”*
- *“Is RPE enough?”*
- *“What should I prioritise with my budget and limited time?”*

Between scientific terms, shiny technologies, and social media posts from elite clubs, it’s easy to feel like you’re falling behind. But the truth is simple:

> You don’t need to monitor **everything**. You just need to monitor the **right things for your context**.

In this article, we’ll break down **internal vs external load**, explain what each actually does for you, and show **what matters most for small and medium clubs** with limited resources.

## What Is Training Load?

Before we split load into internal and external, we need a shared definition.

**Training load** is the *total stress* imposed on an athlete by training and competition. It’s the combination of:

- What the athlete **does** (distance, sprints, jumps, changes of direction); and
- How the athlete’s **body responds** (heart rate, fatigue, perceived exertion, muscle soreness).

In sports science, this is usually divided into:

- **External load** – the *mechanical* work performed.
- **Internal load** – the *physiological and perceptual* response to that work.

Both perspectives are useful – but they aren’t equally realistic for every club.

**Coach Takeaway:**\
Training load is not just “how much they ran.” It’s **what they did + how their body reacted**.

---

## What Is External Load?

**External load** describes the **physical work done by the athlete**. It’s independent of how tired the athlete feels.

### Common External Load Metrics

#### GPS / LPS Metrics

- Total distance
- High-speed running distance
- Sprint distance
- Number of accelerations/decelerations
- Maximum speed

#### Time & Volume Metrics

- Total training time
- Number of repetitions or sets
- Number of jumps, changes of direction, actions per position

These metrics are typically collected through:

- GPS or LPS (local positioning systems)
- Optical tracking (cameras)
- Manual counts (for jumps, shots, sprints)

### Strengths of External Load

#### Strengths

- Objective measurement of **work performed**
- Great for analysing **tactical demands** (e.g., fullback vs central defender)
- Helps design sessions that **replicate or exceed match demands**
- Useful for long-term profiling (e.g., pre-season vs in-season demands)

### Limitations of External Load

#### Limitations

- Requires **hardware and software** (GPS, wearables, or tracking systems), usually not cheap
- Needs **time and expertise** to analyse properly
- Two players can have **identical external load but very different fatigue**
- Harder for small clubs to maintain consistent, high-quality data collection

**Coach Takeaway:**\
External load tells you **what happened on the pitch**, but not necessarily **how heavy that work was for each athlete**.

---

## What Is Internal Load?

**Internal load** describes **how the athlete’s body responds** to training and matches.

Common internal indicators include:

- **RPE / Session-RPE** (how hard the session felt)
- **Heart rate** (average, max, time in zones)
- Blood markers (lactate, etc. – usually research/high-performance only)
- **Wellness** (sleep, fatigue, muscle soreness, mood, stress)

For small and medium clubs, the most realistic tools are:

- **Session-RPE** (RPE × session duration)
- Simple **wellness questionnaires**

### Strengths of Internal Load

#### Strengths

- Captures **individual reaction** to the same training
- Very **low cost** (especially RPE and wellness)
- Requires **minimal equipment** (often just forms or an app)
- Works in any sport and at any level
- Strong scientific support as a valid way to track **internal training load**

### Limitations of Internal Load

#### Limitations

- Rely on athlete honesty and understanding
- Can be influenced by mood, stress, sleep, and external factors
- Heart rate monitoring still requires sensors and setup
- Poor education and inconsistent collection can reduce data quality

**Coach Takeaway:**\
Internal load tells you **how hard the session really was for the athlete**, not just how it looked from the side-line.

---

## Internal vs External Load: What’s the Difference in Practice?

Imagine two players:

- Both ran 8.5 km in training, with similar sprint distances (external load).
- Player A reports RPE 5 (medium effort), Player B reports RPE 8 (very hard).

From an **external load** view, they had the same session.\
From an **internal load** view, Player B experienced a **much heavier stress**.

Why might this happen?

- Player B is coming back from illness.
- Player B slept poorly and is under exam stress.
- Player B is less fit or has accumulated fatigue.

If you only look at external load, you miss the fact that Player B is at higher risk of under-recovery.

**Coach Takeaway:**\
External load shows **what you asked for**. Internal load shows **what the player experienced**.

---

## What Matters Most for Small and Medium Clubs?

If you have:

- Limited budget
- Limited staff
- Limited time for analysis

…you must prioritise the **highest-impact, lowest-friction tools**.

That almost always means:

> **Start with internal load (session-RPE + wellness) and use external load as a bonus if you can afford it.**

### Why Internal Load First?

#### 1. Cost and Accessibility

- RPE and wellness monitoring can be done with **paper, spreadsheets, or accessible platforms** like [Fractall](https://fractall.fit/).
- No need for hardware, subscriptions, or complex installations.

#### 2. Individualisation

- Internal load adjusts for each player’s fitness, fatigue, and context.
- Two players with the same running numbers might need **different recovery strategies**.

#### 3. Time Efficiency

- Asking for RPE and wellness takes **1–2 minutes per day**.
- Analysing simple trends weekly is realistic for coaches who have many other tasks.

### Where External Load Fits In

If you already have GPS or tracking systems, you can absolutely use them – but think of them as:

- **Level 2**: Advanced detail on top of a solid internal load base.
- A way to refine session design (e.g., ensuring MD-3 includes enough high-speed running).

For most small clubs, the sequence should be:

1. **Level 1** – Internal load only: session-RPE, weekly load, and wellness
1. **Level 2** – Internal + external: add simple GPS metrics if and when possible

**Coach Takeaway:**\
If you try to copy what elite clubs do without their staff or budget, you’ll often create **extra work with little extra value**. Start with internal load and grow from there.

---

## A Simple Framework: Levels of Load Monitoring

Here’s a realistic progression for small and medium clubs.

### Level 1 – Internal Load Only (Baseline for Everyone)

#### Tools

- Session-RPE (RPE × duration)
- Weekly load
- Basic wellness (sleep, fatigue, soreness, stress, mood)

#### What You Can Do

- Identify **spikes in weekly load** for individuals.
- See who is struggling to cope (high RPE + poor wellness).
- Adjust training content or volume for overloaded players.
- Compare **training vs match demands** using session-RPE.

### Level 2 – Internal + Simple External Load

#### Tools

- Everything from Level 1
- Basic GPS metrics (total distance, high-speed distance, sprint count), if available

#### What You Can Do

- Check if your sessions **match or exceed** game demands.
- Better design sessions for specific positions (e.g., wingers vs centre backs).
- Cross-check: high external + low internal might indicate positive adaptation; consistently high-high may signal risk.

### Level 3 – Integrated Performance Department (Not the Priority)

This is where:

- You have full GPS/LPS, heart rate, gym tracking, medical data.
- You have staff dedicated to analysis.

**Most small and medium clubs don’t need to chase Level 3.** If you do Level 1 well, you’re already ahead of the majority.

**Coach Takeaway:**\
Don’t wait until you can afford everything. **Do Level 1 brilliantly before you even think about Level 3.**

## How to Use Internal Load If You Have No Technology

You can build an effective **internal training load monitoring** system with almost no tools.

### Step 1 – Define Your RPE Scale

Use the 0–10 scale and explain it clearly (e.g., 0 = rest, 10 = maximal).

### Step 2 – Decide Your Routine

- Collect RPE **20–30 minutes after each session and match**.
- Record **duration** and **RPE** for each player.
- Calculate **session load = RPE × duration**.
- Sum sessions to get **weekly load**.

### Step 3 – Add Simple Wellness

Ask players (daily or at least on key days):

- How was your **sleep**?
- How **fatigued** do you feel?
- How is your **muscle soreness**?
- How is your **stress**?
- How is your **mood**?

Use a simple 1–5 scale and watch for **negative trends** or consistent low scores.

### Step 4 – Weekly Review

Once per week:

- Look at **weekly loads** per player.
- Flag big increases or decreases.
- Combine with wellness to spot players needing extra care.
- Adjust next week’s plan (volume, intensity, or recovery) accordingly.

**Coach Takeaway:**\
Internal load monitoring can be done with **pen, paper, and 20 minutes per week** – no excuses.

## How to Use External Load Without Overcomplicating Things

If you have GPS or another tracking system, keep it simple.

### Focus on a Few Key Metrics

- Total distance
- High-speed running distance (define your threshold clearly)
- Sprint count
- Maybe PlayerLoad™ or similar composite metrics if your system provides them

### Ask These Questions

- Do my **training sessions** reach or exceed match demands for the key metrics?
- Is the **distribution across the week** logical? (e.g., higher on MD-3 vs MD-1)
- Are some players consistently doing more or less than their positional peers?

### Combine with Internal Load

For example:

- **High external + high internal** → Very demanding; use with intention and ensure recovery.
- **High external + low internal** → Positive adaptation, or player under-reporting RPE (check context).
- **Low external + high internal** → Player may be fatigued, unwell, stressed, or deconditioned.

**Coach Takeaway:**\
If external load is available, use it to **validate and refine** your training design – but don’t let it replace your **internal view of the athlete**.

---

## Coach-Friendly Summary & Checklist

### Key Points

- **External load** = what the athlete *does* (distance, sprints, actions).
- **Internal load** = how the athlete’s *body responds* (RPE, HR, wellness).
- For small and medium clubs, **internal load is the best first priority**.
- External load is **nice-to-have**, especially if you already have GPS, but not essential to start managing load well.

### Do’s

- **Do** start with session-RPE and weekly load.
- **Do** add wellness to get a fuller picture of fatigue and readiness.
- **Do** review data weekly and adjust training based on trends.
- **Do** use external load (if available) to check if your sessions match match demands.
- **Do** keep your system simple and sustainable.

### Don’ts

- **Don’t** copy elite clubs’ tech without their staff or time.
- **Don’t** rely only on external data and ignore how players feel.
- **Don’t** collect data you never review.
- **Don’t** change metrics every month – consistency beats complexity.

### “Start This Month” Checklist

1. Choose your **RPE scale** (0–10) and educate players.
1. Implement **session-RPE** after every main session and match.
1. Track **weekly load** per player.
1. Add a **5-question wellness check** on key days.
1. Sit down once a week for **15–20 minutes** to review trends.
1. Make **one clear adjustment** to next week’s plan based on what you see.
1. If you later add GPS, use it to **enhance**, not replace, your internal monitoring.

**Coach Takeaway:**\
For most small and medium clubs, **getting internal load right will give you 80% of the value for 20% of the cost and effort.**

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### 1. Do I need GPS to monitor training load properly?

No. GPS is helpful but not essential, especially for small and medium clubs. A well-structured **internal load system** using session-RPE and wellness can already provide a strong foundation for training load monitoring.

---

### 2. Which is more important: internal or external load?

If you have to choose, **internal load** is more important in most small and medium club contexts. External load tells you what happened; internal load tells you how demanding it was for each player. Ideally you use both, but internal is the better starting point.

---

### 3. Can I monitor internal load without any technology?

Yes. You can monitor internal load using:

- A printed RPE scale
- A notebook or spreadsheet
- Simple questions about wellness

Technology (like [Fractall](https://fractall.fit/)) makes the process smoother and more scalable, but it is not a requirement to start.

---

### 4. How often should I collect internal load data?

Aim to collect:

- **Session-RPE** after every main training session and every match
- **Wellness** at least on key days (e.g., the morning after matches, and before heavier training days)

---

### 5. What’s the biggest mistake clubs make with load monitoring?

The biggest mistake is **collecting data without using it**. Whether you use GPS, RPE, or both, the value comes from **reviewing trends and making decisions** based on what you see – not just filling in numbers.
