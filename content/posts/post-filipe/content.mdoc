# RPE Basics for Coaches: How to Use Session-RPE to Monitor Training Load

Monitoring training load shouldn’t require a sports science department or expensive GPS systems. Yet many coaches still rely on “feel”, rough notes, or endless spreadsheets to decide whether their team is training too hard, too little, or just right.

The result?\
Weeks that are harder than you think. Players arriving at the weekend already fatigued. Or the opposite – match intensity that your training simply didn’t prepare them for.

**Session-RPE** is one of the simplest and most powerful tools you can use for **training load monitoring**. It’s low-cost, easy to teach athletes, and works across football, futsal, basketball and most team sports.

This article walks you through exactly how to use RPE and session-RPE in your daily coaching: from definitions to step-by-step implementation, common mistakes, and practical examples from real training weeks.

## What Is RPE?

**RPE** stands for **Rating of Perceived Exertion**. It’s the athlete’s own perception of how hard a session felt.

Instead of looking at distance, speed or heart rate, RPE asks:

> “Overall, how hard was this session for you?”

Coaches use a simple **RPE scale**. Two of the most common are:

- **0–10 scale** (modified Borg)
- **6–20 scale** (original Borg)

For most coaches and athletes, the **0–10 scale** is easier and more intuitive.

A typical 0–10 **RPE scale for coaches** might look like:

{% table %}
- RPE
- Description
- Example feeling
---
- 0
- Rest
- No effort at all
---
- 3
- Moderate
- Comfortable, could continue for a long time
---
- 5
- Hard
- Working, but controlled
---
- 7
- Very hard
- Tough session, strong effort required
---
- 9
- Extremely hard
- Almost maximal, very challenging
---
- 10
- Maximal
- All-out effort, cannot sustain longer
{% /table %}

You can refine the descriptors for your sport, but the key is **consistency**: athletes must understand what “5” vs “8” feels like in the context of your training.

**Coach Takeaway:**\
**RPE is the athlete’s internal “volume knob” for effort.** When used consistently, it becomes a simple language you and your players share about session intensity.

---

## What Is Session-RPE and How Is It Calculated?

RPE alone tells you how hard the session felt. But as a coach, you also care about **how long** the player worked at that intensity.

That’s where **session-RPE** comes in.

### The Session-RPE Formula

> **Session Load = RPE × Session Duration (minutes)**

This gives you a single number that represents the athlete’s **internal training load** for that session.

**Example (football training)**

- Session duration: 75 minutes
- Player’s RPE: 7 (“very hard”)

> **Session Load = 7 × 75 = 525 AU**\
(AU = Arbitrary Units)

Now you can compare loads between:

- Different players in the same session
- Different sessions across the week
- Training sessions vs matches

All using the same simple metric.

Why is this powerful?

- It transforms a subjective feeling into a **quantified load value**.
- It makes **team sports load monitoring** possible even without external devices.
- It works across football training load, futsal conditioning, basketball practices, and more.

**Coach Takeaway:**\
**Session-RPE turns “it felt hard” into a usable number.** That number becomes the foundation of your training load monitoring.

## Why Internal Load Matters for Small and Medium Clubs

In an ideal world, every club would have GPS, heart rate systems, and force plates. In reality, many small and medium clubs don’t have the budget, staff, or time.

This is where **internal load** is your best ally.

### Internal vs External Load (Simple View)

- **External load:**\
  What the athlete *did* (distance, high-speed running, accelerations, jumps, etc.).
- **Internal load:**\
  How the athlete’s body *responded* (RPE, heart rate, blood markers, etc.).

Even when two players cover the same distance at the same speed, their **internal training load** can be very different due to fitness, fatigue, stress, or injury history.

For small clubs:

- External load tech may be **too expensive** or hard to manage.
- Internal load via RPE/session-RPE is **cheap, universal, and quick**.
- It respects the athlete’s **subjective experience**, which research consistently shows is valuable for understanding fatigue and readiness.

**Benefits of focusing on internal load:**

- Works with **simple tools** (forms, apps, or platforms like [Fractall](https://fractall.fit/)).
- Easy to implement in **football, futsal, basketball, handball** and more.
- Gives a **whole-squad view** of how demanding your week really was.

**Coach Takeaway:**\
If you can’t measure everything, measure what matters most and is **realistic for your context**. Session-RPE gives you a robust, science-backed metric without needing hardware.

## How to Implement Session-RPE Step-by-Step

Here’s a practical, **tomorrow-ready** process to implement session-RPE in your team.

### 1. Choose Your RPE Scale

Use the **0–10 scale** for simplicity.

Define it clearly to players. For example:

- 0 = Rest
- 5 = Hard but controlled
- 7 = Very hard
- 10 = Maximal effort

You can show this on a printed poster in the gym or changing room.

### 2. Decide When to Ask for RPE

Timing is crucial.

- Collect RPE **20–30 minutes after the end** of the session.
- This reduces the influence of the very last drill and allows athletes to rate the **overall session**.

You can:

- Ask them individually as they leave.
- Use a digital form/app they fill in on their phone.
- Use a monitoring platform that centralizes responses.

### 3. Educate Your Athletes

Spend 5–10 minutes explaining:

- Why you are doing this (to help them, not to judge them).
- How the scale works.
- That **honesty is crucial** – “7” is not better than “5”; it just means a different session type.

Initially, you may need to correct some players:

> “If that felt quite comfortable and you could do much more, maybe that’s a 4, not a 7.”

### 4. Record the Values

For each session, record:

- Date
- Session type (e.g., MD-3, MD-1, strength, recovery)
- Duration in minutes
- RPE from each athlete

Then, calculate:

> **Session Load = RPE × Duration**

Even in a simple spreadsheet, you can compute this automatically.\
A platform like [**Fractall**](https://fractall.fit/) can centralize this and generate instant visualizations, but the core idea is the same.

### 5. Calculate Weekly Load

Sum each player’s **session loads** across the week:

> **Weekly Load = Σ session loads (for that week)**

Example (football training load – single player):

{% table %}
- Day
- Type
- Duration
- RPE
- Session Load
---
- Mon
- MD-3
- 75 min
- 6
- 450 AU
---
- Tue
- MD-2
- 60 min
- 7
- 420 AU
---
- Thu
- MD-1
- 45 min
- 4
- 180 AU
---
- Sat
- Match
- 95 min
- 8
- 760 AU
{% /table %}

**Weekly Load = 450 + 420 + 180 + 760 = 1,810 AU**

Now you can compare:

- This week vs last week
- This player vs others
- Training load vs perceived match demands

### 6. Repeat Consistently

You’ll get the most value when you:

- Collect RPE for **every main session and game**.
- Keep the scaling, timing, and messaging consistent.
- Review data at least **once per week**.

**Coach Takeaway:**\
**Session-RPE works if you treat it like any other key coaching habit.** Clear scale, consistent timing, simple recording, and weekly review.

## Interpreting Session-RPE Data: Practical Coaching Use Cases

Once you’re collecting session-RPE, how do you turn numbers into decisions?

Here are some practical examples.

### 1. Comparing Training Days (MD-3 vs MD-1)

You may plan:

- MD-3 = High load
- MD-1 = Light, tactical, low load

Session loads should usually reflect that.

Example:

- MD-3: average load across squad = 500–600 AU
- MD-1: average load across squad = 150–250 AU

If MD-1 loads creep up near MD-3 (e.g., 400–500 AU), you may be doing too much the day before a match.

### 2. Tracking Weekly Load Over Time

You can monitor whether your **weekly load** is:

- Progressively increasing during pre-season.
- Stable during competitive periods.
- Reduced in deload weeks or during congested fixtures.

If a player’s weekly load jumps by **30–40%** compared to their previous weeks, that’s a flag to check, even without GPS.

### 3. Spotting Atypical Spikes or Drops

Examples:

- A player who usually reports RPE 5–6 suddenly reports 8–9 in a normal session.
- A normally demanding drill produces surprisingly low RPE and session load.

These situations may indicate:

- Accumulated fatigue, poor sleep, or external stress (if RPE is higher).
- Adaptation/fitness gains or low engagement/intensity (if RPE is lower).

**Coach Takeaway:**\
**Use session-RPE trends, not single values.** Patterns over weeks tell you who is coping well, who needs protection, and where your session design might not match your goals.

## Common Mistakes When Using RPE and How to Avoid Them

Even though session-RPE is simple, there are common traps. Here are 6 mistakes and fixes.

### Mistake 1: Inconsistent Timing

#### Mistake

Sometimes asking right after training, sometimes an hour later.

#### Fix

Standardize: collect RPE **20–30 minutes post-session** every time.

**Coach Takeaway:**\
Consistency in timing = consistency in data.

---

### Mistake 2: Poor Athlete Education

#### Mistake

Athletes are never properly taught the scale, so they randomly pick numbers.

#### Fix

Spend time explaining the scale, give examples, and check their understanding early on.

**Coach Takeaway:**\
Invest one session in education, save months of low-quality data.

---

### Mistake 3: Using RPE as a “Test” of Toughness

#### Mistake

Players believe high RPE is “good” and low RPE is “soft”, so they bias responses.

#### Fix

Emphasize that RPE is **not a performance score**. It’s information to help manage load and protect them.

**Coach Takeaway:**\
RPE is about **honest communication**, not judgment.

---

### Mistake 4: Ignoring Context

#### Mistake

Interpreting a high RPE without considering heat, travel, stress, or recent matches.

#### Fix

When RPE is unexpectedly high or low, ask: “What could explain this today?”

**Coach Takeaway:**\
Numbers don’t replace coaching; they support better questions.

---

### Mistake 5: Not Combining RPE with Session Duration

#### Mistake

Looking only at the RPE number and not calculating **session load**.

#### Fix

Always multiply by duration to compare sessions and weeks accurately.

**Coach Takeaway:**\
**RPE × minutes** is what turns impressions into training load monitoring.

---

### Mistake 6: Collecting Data but Never Reviewing It

#### Mistake

Gathering RPE after every session, but never analyzing it.

#### Fix

Schedule a **weekly 15–20 minute review** to check player loads, weekly totals, and notable spikes.

**Coach Takeaway:**\
Your monitoring system is only as good as the decisions you make with it.

---

## Combining RPE with Wellness for a Better Picture

Session-RPE is powerful on its own, but it becomes even more valuable when combined with **wellness monitoring**.

Key wellness indicators:

- Sleep quality
- Fatigue
- Muscle soreness
- Stress
- Mood

### Example: A Red Flag Pattern

Over 4–5 days, you notice:

- RPE values are high (7–8) in ordinary sessions.
- Wellness scores show poor sleep, high fatigue, and increased soreness.

Even if external training load hasn’t changed, this combination suggests:

- The athlete is **struggling to recover**.
- You may need to **adjust their individual load**, add recovery strategies, or investigate further.

On the other hand:

- Stable or improving wellness + progressively increased session-RPE load can indicate **positive adaptation**.

**Coach Takeaway:**\
**Session-RPE tells you how hard the session was. Wellness tells you how ready the player was to handle it.** Together, they give a more complete view of injury risk and performance readiness.

## Coach-Friendly Summary & Checklist

### Key Definitions

- **RPE:** Athlete’s rating of how hard a session felt.
- **Session-RPE:** RPE × duration (minutes) = **internal training load** in AU.
- **Weekly Load:** Sum of all session loads in a week.

### Do’s

- **Do** use a simple 0–10 RPE scale and explain it clearly.
- **Do** collect RPE 20–30 minutes after each session and match.
- **Do** calculate session load and weekly load for each player.
- **Do** review trends weekly and look for spikes or drops.
- **Do** combine session-RPE with wellness data when possible.

### Don’ts

- **Don’t** change the scale or timing frequently.
- **Don’t** treat RPE as a “toughness” score.
- **Don’t** ignore context (travel, stress, illness, heat).
- **Don’t** collect data if you’re never going to look at it.
- **Don’t** rely only on external data if you have no capacity to manage it.

### “Start Tomorrow” Checklist

You can start a basic session-RPE system in one week:

1. Choose a **0–10 RPE scale** and print it for players.
1. Explain the scale at the next training session.
1. Decide your standard timing: **20–30 minutes post-session**.
1. Create a simple sheet or form with: date, session type, duration, player name, RPE.
1. After each session, collect RPE from all players and calculate session load.
1. At the end of the week, compute **weekly load** for each player and note:
   - Highest and lowest loads
   - Any big jumps vs previous weeks
1. Adjust next week’s plan based on what you see (e.g., slightly lower MD-1, extra recovery for overloaded players).

**Coach Takeaway:**\
You don’t need perfect data or complex tools to start. **A simple, consistent session-RPE routine already puts you ahead of most teams.**

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### 1. What is a good RPE scale to use in football?

For football and most team sports, the **0–10 scale** is usually the easiest to teach and apply. It’s intuitive, works well with players of different ages, and integrates smoothly into session-RPE calculations. The key is to define the descriptors clearly and use the same scale consistently.

---

### 2. How many times per week should I collect RPE?

Ideally, you should collect RPE:

- After **every main training session**
- After **every match**

This allows you to calculate accurate **session loads** and **weekly loads**, and to follow patterns over time.

---

### 3. Can I use session-RPE without any technology?

Yes. You can start with:

- A printed RPE scale
- A clipboard or paper sheet
- A simple spreadsheet

Technology and platforms (like [Fractall](https://fractall.fit/)) make it easier and faster, especially with larger squads or multiple teams, but they are not strictly required to begin.

---

### 4. How long does it take for players to give reliable RPE scores?

Most players adapt fairly quickly if you **explain the scale well** and use it consistently. Within **2–3 weeks**, you’ll usually see more stable, realistic scores. Early on, you may need to coach their understanding (e.g., helping them calibrate what “5” or “8” feels like).

---

### 5. Does session-RPE replace GPS and other external load tools?

No – it doesn’t replace them, but it can **complement or stand in for them**, especially in clubs without access to expensive hardware. External load tells you **what** players did; internal load (session-RPE) tells you **how their body responded**. Together, they offer the most complete picture, but session-RPE alone is already a powerful, evidence-informed tool for training load monitoring.
